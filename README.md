# Vim and custom functions
My personal vimrc and custom funcitons for daily use

# What I use as my plugins?
Plug '~/.vim/plugged/custom-functions'  
Plug 'vimwiki/vimwiki'  
Plug 'majutsushi/tagbar'  

*yes, the custom functions file must be initialized and installed like a plugin*  
Nope, no autocomplete here.  

# Todo
1. Make a function to verify if the customfunctions.vim exist or not in the right place
2. [thinking on...]

# About the number 1
I know, I know, it's easy to make a function to do that, but I'm trying to study differents commands on vim and maybe a better way to do the 'common'.  
I'm not trying to 'reinvent the wheel', I'm just trying to learn more!!
